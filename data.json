The founder Francesco Firano blamed Nano developers and demanded reversing the transactions, while the developers denied the issue was in the protocol, rather in BitGrail's software. The Italian Bankruptcy Court found the vulnerability was with BitGrail and sentenced the owner and the exchange company to repay lost funds to the maximum available extent. Both also declared bankruptcy.",
